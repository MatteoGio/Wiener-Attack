# Wiener attack

This is a paper presenting the functioning of RSA cryptosystem, its major and most commmon attacks, together with the elegant attack M.J.Wiener published in 1990. A simple implementation in *Wolfram Mathematica* is included in the end. [Have a look](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatteoGiorgi/wiener_attack/blob/master/assets/code/wiener_attack.pdf) ;)
